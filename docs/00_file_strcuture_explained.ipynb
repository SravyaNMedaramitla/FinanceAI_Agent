    "# AI Agent File Structure Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents have a specialized file structure because they are not just chatbots or single LLM calls. They are evolving intelligent systems with memory, tools, reasoning, and workflows.\n",

    "## 2. Why This Structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Separation of Concerns\n",
    "Each part of the agent has a single responsibility:\n",
    "- `core/` contains reusable logic for prompts, memory access, and decision-making.\n",
    "- `application/` orchestrates these services in response to user input.\n",
    "- `infrastructure/` handles the real-world interfaces like LLMs, vector DBs, or monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalable Design\n",
    "You can:\n",
    "- Add new agents (e.g., BudgetAdvisor, StockAnalyst)\n",
    "- Plug in tools (e.g., Tax Calculator, Stock Lookup API)\n",
    "- Switch providers (OpenAI → Claude, FAISS → Pinecone)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without rewriting core logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reusability\n",
    "You can:\n",
    "- Reuse prompt templates across different services\n",
    "- Reuse memory logic and context builders in new workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintainability\n",
    "The clean boundaries make it easy for new devs (or future you) to debug and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DevOps & Deployment Friendly\n",
    "Structure aligns with:\n",
    "- GitHub Actions / CI pipelines\n",
    "- Docker and cloud deployment\n",
    "- API exposure via FastAPI/Flask\n",

    "##  3. Special Purpose Folders\n",

    "### `notebooks/`\n",

    "- Prompt engineering\n",
    "- Testing memory lookups\n",
    "- Tool execution prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "> Once stable, move code to `core/` or `application/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `tools/`\n",
    "Operational scripts for:\n",
    "- Populating/deleting vector DB entries\n",
    "- Evaluating agent performance\n",
    "- Finetuning LLMs (if applicable)\n",
    "\n",
    "### `tests/`\n",
    "Covers:\n",
    "- Prompt correctness\n",
    "- Agent logic\n",
    "- Tool invocation\n",
    "- API response formats\n",

    "- Cleaner collaboration\n",
    "- Production-readiness from Day 1\n"
